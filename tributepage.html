    <h2><b>Introduction</b></h2>
    <p>Nikola Tesla was a Serbian-American inventor, electrical engineer, mechanical engineer, and futurist best known
        for his contributions to the design of the modern alternating current (AC) electricity supply system.</p>
    <p>Born and raised in the Austrian Empire, Tesla studied engineering and physics in the 1870s without receiving a
        degree, gaining practical experience in the early 1880s working in telephony and at Continental Edison in the
        new electric power industry. In 1884 he emigrated to the United States, where he became a naturalized citizen.
        He worked for a short time at the Edison Machine Works in New York City before he struck out on his own. With
        the help of partners to finance and market his ideas, Tesla set up laboratories and companies in New York to
        develop a range of electrical and mechanical devices. His alternating current (AC) induction motor and related
        polyphase AC patents, licensed by Westinghouse Electric in 1888, earned him a considerable amount of money and
        became the cornerstone of the polyphase system which that company eventually marketed.</p>
    <h2><b>Childhood</b></h2>
    <p>Nikola Tesla was born an ethnic Serb in the village of Smiljan, within the Military Frontier, in the Austrian
        Empire
        (present day Croatia), on 10 July [O.S. 28 June] 1856.His father, Milutin Tesla (1819–1879),[16] was a priest of
        the
        Eastern Orthodox Church.</p>
    <p>
        Tesla's mother, Đuka Mandić (1822–1892), whose father was also an Eastern Orthodox Church priest,[21] had a
        talent for
        making home craft tools and mechanical appliances and the ability to memorize Serbian epic poems. Đuka had never
        received a formal education. Tesla credited his eidetic memory and creative abilities to his mother's genetics
        and
        influence.Tesla's progenitors were from western Serbia, near Montenegro.</p>

    <p>Tesla was the fourth of five children. He had three sisters, Milka, Angelina, and Marica, and an older brother
        named
        Dane, who was killed in a horse riding accident when Tesla was aged five.In 1861, Tesla attended primary school
        in
        Smiljan where he studied German, arithmetic, and religion. In 1862, the Tesla family moved to the nearby Gospić,
        where
        Tesla's father worked as parish priest. Nikola completed primary school, followed by middle school. In 1870,
        Tesla moved
        to Karlovac [better source needed] to attend high school at the Higher Real Gymnasium where the classes were
        held in
        German, as it was usual throughout schools within the Austro-Hungarian Military Frontier.</p>


    <p>Tesla's father, Milutin, was an Orthodox priest in the village of Smiljan.
        Tesla later wrote that he became interested in demonstrations of electricity by his physics professor.Tesla
        noted that
        these demonstrations of this "mysterious phenomena" made him want "to know more of this wonderful force".Tesla
        was able
        to perform integral calculus in his head, which prompted his teachers to believe that he was cheating.He
        finished a
        four-year term in three years, graduating in 1873</p>
    <h2>Education</h2>
    <p>Tesla studied at several places in Europe, which also included Germany, Austria, and Prague. At the Austrian
        Polytechnic
        in Graz, he pursued electrical engineering, and later, joined the Charles-Ferdinand University in Prague.</p>

    <p> He had the opportunity to go to Budapest in the late 1870s, where he worked at the Telephone Exchange. He made
        enhancements to some inventions and came up with an idea for the induction motor, which produced an alternating
        current
        system, and used electromagnetic induction from the magnetic field instead of electrical connections to the
        rotor.</p>

    <p> At age 28, in 1884, he decided to move to the U.S., in search of more opportunities. Tesla met Thomas Edison in
        the U.S.
        Tesla worked alongside him for a couple of months. When Edison declined to pay Tesla for his work, Tesla decided
        to quit
        and pursue his journey as an inventor.</p>

    <p>Tesla’s legacy holds nine decorations with certificates of honours with which the scientist was decorated between
        1892
        and 1939.</p>

        <b>Contribution in Alternating Currents (AC)</b>
            Nikola Tesla’s best-known invention was Alternating Current. AC power permits electricity to be sent over extended
            distances much more efficiently.
        
            Tesla’s AC patents were accepted by Westinghouse and used for the lighting of the Chicago World’s Fair. Tesla’s  apparent
            essential skill for invention and profound imagination made him one of the most prolific inventors of our times.
            Clearly, his genius was unmatched in his time and perhaps ours.</p>
        <b>Tesla Coil</b>
            Perhaps the most well-known symbol of Tesla’s work is the Tesla coil. It is a transformer that produces   high-voltage,
            low-current, high-frequency alternating-current electricity.
        
            A Tesla coil comprises a primary coil and secondary coil, each coil with its own capacitor to store electrical   energy. A
            spark gap links both the coils and capacitors. The system is powered by a high-voltage source. As the current   flows out
            of the capacitor down the primary coil, a magnetic field is created.
        
            This field breaks down quickly and produces an electric current in the secondary coil. The subsequent        high-frequency
            voltage can lighten fluorescent bulbs several feet away with no wire connection.</p>
     
        <b> Magnifying Transmitter</b>
            Building upon the revelations of the Tesla coil, Tesla sought to offer wireless power for free to all by transmitting
            information from one tower to another using resonance. The currents were sent from one circuit to the other, building in
            frequency until lightning sparked from one tower to the other. By connecting a wire to the tower and running it around
            his lab, he powered his laboratory wirelessly. He demonstrated the effect on stage to audiences using light bulbs that
            were not connected to any power source. The magnifying transmitter succeeded in transmitting an electrical current a
            kilometer away.
            
        <b>Tesla Turbine</b>
            Tesla developed a piston engine to power automobiles using combustion to rotate disks. At the time, commonly used
            turbines were less efficient and relied on blades. Tesla’s invention merged many disks to create a centrifugal pump. By
            moving fluid in the path of least resistance, his turbine was more fuel-efficient. His turbine is also known as “…the
            boundary-layer turbine, cohesion-type turbine, and Prandtl-layer turbine it uses the boundary-layer effect and not a
            fluid impinging upon the blades as in a conventional turbine.” (Wikipedia)
            
            Smooth disks with nozzles circulate fluid around the edge of the disk. As the disk spins, the fluid adheres to the edge
            of the disk and is drawn from the edge of disk to the center. It works by adhesion rather than friction, resulting in
            greater efficiency.
            
        <b>The Shadowgraph</b>
            The Shadowgraph is another name for x-rays, but Tesla’s term is actually more depictive of the process. An x-ray creates
            a silhouette of the area captured by passing radioactive waves through the human body. Although the invention was
            initially developed by Rontgen, Tesla made improvements to the technique to render clearer images.
            
        <b>Radio</b>
            Before his lab burned down, Tesla was working on developing a radio intended to transmit a signal fifty miles. Prior to
            its completion, however, another gentleman received a patent for a similar radio design in England. Had he succeeded,
            Nikola Tesla’s invention would have surpassed the Brit’s invention in strength.
            
        <b>Neon Lamp</b>
            The neon lamp (or sign) was Tesla’s modification of existing neon light technology to form words and designs. Neon signs
            continue to exist worldwide, lighting up bars, casinos, hotels, and other signs along the roadway.
            
        <b>Hydroelectric Power</b>
            The Niagara Falls Commission selected Tesla to design the hydroelectric power generator at Niagara Falls using his
            alternating power technology. Considered the first power plant, Tesla’s technology was used throughout the world to
            provide electricity to the masses.
            
        <b>Induction Motor</b>
            Using electromagnets to spin, Tesla’s induction motor currently powers everyday household items such as vacuums,
            hairdryers and power tools.
            
        <b>Radio-controlled Boat</b>
            Tesla used radio transmission to power the first radio-controlled toy boat, controlling its engine, lighting and
            steering with a remote control. Today’s drones are based on this technology. While some viewed his invention as a
            contribution to warfare, i.e. torpedoes, Tesla considered it the beginning of robotic technology which would eventually
            handle the majority of labor for man.
            
            Many of Nikola Tesla’s inventions went unrecognized, others lost when his notes were destroyed by fire. At the end of
            his life, his research was confiscated by the FBI, and only in recent years has it been made available to the public.

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>In conclusion, Nikola Tesla and his inventions changed lives for ever. Tesla's AC invention gave millions of people power
        to their homes. This gave so many more opportunities for inventions and gave power to technology that needed
        electricity. Tesla's laser made operations more safer and helped people who needed operations for health reasons.
        Tesla's radio brought communication to a whole new level. These radios were now used in wars, alerts, and for personal
        use today, which also improved life for Americans. Overall, all of Nikola Tesla's inventions basically improved life for
        all Americans and possibly the world now. Without Mr. Tesla, who knows what our life would be like today?
